Jesus **is** the King.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate!

# **ABOUT ME**

I enjoy programming.

Still learning a lot of things, this is why I adore it.

My native language is Romanian, and I'm fluent in English.

ðŸ’¬ I'm a very curious person, so if I'm learning something new, I love to dig deeper into research!
