## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nicoleta, you can call me Nico. 
I enjoy programming in my free time, and honestly even if I don't have time I still have the urge to codeðŸ˜…
After high school I will continue my studies into the university.

My native language is Romanian, and I'm fluent in English.

You can reach me [here](nicoletaworkshop@gmail.com)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning c++ and python, along with some arduino projects.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate! You can contact me via my gmail.
ðŸ’¬I'm a very curious person, so if I'm learning something new, I have to dig deeper into the information gathering.
